In this project, you are required to design and implement a small security application built on top of the DES implementation that you have just completed in Project #1. You may also choose to carry out some in-depth study of the encryption/decryption algorithm(s).Performance comparison between DES and RSA: The goal is to study the performance of the two encryption algorithms of different kinds, i.e., a secret key based algorithm and a public key based algorithm. Again, the evaluation criterion is the length of time that it takes to complete encryption (or decryption) of a message. You may need to use multiple messages of different sizes to reach a conclusion.Performance comparison between DES and RSA: The goal is to study the performance of the two encryption algorithms of different kinds, i.e., a secret key based algorithm and a public key based algorithm.
